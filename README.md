# SchoolProgressTrackers
Goal is to create a project with all my knowledge at the start of each semester to see how my skills progress from self taught to IT professional

Roguelike - This project was started mid-first semester, uses self taught spaghetti code techniques to hack together a mostly functional game
Missing enemy AI, requires pressing enter after each input.

Virtupet - This project was started at the end of first semester to demonstrate my new Python and UI skills. 
Some animations are absent and no minigame was implemented.
